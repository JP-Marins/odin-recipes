    <h1>Smoked Salmon Sushi</h1>
    <img src="../images/sushi.jpg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>Six tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Six sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
        <li>Eight ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
        <li>One cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>One avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
        <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
    </ol>
